							<p>VMI is an evidence-based virtual mobile game used to train social workers in the skill of motivational interviewing, an important skill for talking to clients.
								It is one part of the larger software suite known as the Virtual Social Work Trainer (VSWT) Software Suite.
							</p>
							<p>Users are placed in simulated conversations with clients, and are presented with several response options to continue the conversation. The player is given a score
								 based on how effective their responses are, and they have access to several learning modules to improve their motivational interviewing. This application is
								currently being used in the state of Utah to train social workers in the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS)

						<h2>My Role</h2>
						<p>
							<li>UI Refactor</li>
							<li>Software Architecture</li>
							<li>Database Migration</li>
							<br/>
							&nbsp &nbsp I have done work on improving the UI and UX of the application through visual refactors and weekly feedback on new layouts and features.
							Additionally, this application has also undergone a database migration from Azure and Firebase to a new AWS architecture.
							<br/>
							&nbsp &nbsp This project has been a great professional study in designing an application's layout and user's experience. The work I've
							done required me to learn about UX design and really put myself into the shoes of the end user when making design decisions. Two of the
							biggest changes I implemented was increasing accessibility by making the UI more legible and easy to navigate, and reducing the cognitive
							load of the user by presenting information in a more intuitive and visually-pleasing way. Being a conversation-based learning application 
							the work required finding a balance between showing as much information as possible to reduce the amount of information needed to memorize
							while also making it easy to understand and learn from by avoiding information overload. This was a very collaborative effort between myself
							, the art team, and the social work experts providing the content for this project.
